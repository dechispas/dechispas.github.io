      Mad Libs was invented in 1953 by
        <input type= "text" placeholder="name 1">
      and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">.
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1">
      and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
      co-created the game,
      but couldn't agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1">
      and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
      were eating
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "food">
      at a restaurant in
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "place">.
      While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">
      and an
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">.
      According to
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1">
      and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
      , during the overheard argument, the
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">
      said that he wanted to "ad-lib" an upcoming interview. The
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">
      , who clearly disagreed with the
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">'s
      suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be "mad".
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1"> and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
      used that eavesdropped conversation to finally create the name "Mad Libs". The duo released the first Mad Libs book themselves in 1958. The first Mad Libs resembled the earlier games of Consequences and Exquisite Corpse.

      and
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
      next partnered with
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 3">,
      a high school friend who was working as a
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "occupation">
      at the time, to continue publishing Mad Libs.
      Together, the three founded the publishing firm
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1">
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 3">
      in the early 1960s as a way to release Mad Libs.
      In addition to releasing more than 70 editions of Mad Libs under
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 1">,
      the company also published 150 softcover books,
      including such notable titles as How to Be a
      <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">,
      first released in 1964;
      <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">,
      which was also created by
        <input type= "text" placeholder= "name 2">;
      The VIP Desk <input type= "text" placeholder= "noun">;
      and the series, World's Worst
